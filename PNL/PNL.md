# PNL

We will use the Python programming language for all assignments in this course. Python is a great generalpurpose programming language on its own, but with the help of a few popular libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) it becomes a powerful environment for scientic computing.

So it is just a quick crash course both on th Python programming language and on the use of Python for scientific computing.
